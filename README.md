# My Website - available at pranavbala.com

This repository contains all of the HTML Files used to build my website.

This portfolio website is built using a Python Django backend, with the user interface styled by Tailwind CSS. It dynamically renders project and video data from a database and utilizes JavaScript to handle the light and dark mode theme switching. The entire application is deployed within a Docker container to create a portable and secure production environment.

Unfortunately, due to security reasons, I am unable to provide the backend code at this time.
